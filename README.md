# Drac At Nite
Greetings, fiends and changelings of the night! 🦇

Need a deep theme to sink your fangs into? I present to you a truly deep theme for Visual Studio IDE inspired by the color palate from @bceskavich's VS Code theme "Dracula at Night". It covers more than syntax coloring but all the elements and controls in Visual Studio. If something was missed feel free to contribute with a PR!
